-- | A sample hash function for Strings.  We keep multiplying by the
-- golden ratio and adding.  The implementation is:
--
-- > hashString = foldl' f golden
-- >   where f m c = fromIntegral (ord c) * magic + hashInt32 m
-- >         magic = 0xdeadbeef
--
-- Where hashInt32 works just as hashInt shown above.
--
-- Knuth argues that repeated multiplication by the golden ratio
-- will minimize gaps in the hash space, and thus it's a good choice
-- for combining together multiple keys to form one.
--
-- Here we know that individual characters c are often small, and this
-- produces frequent collisions if we use ord c alone.  A
-- particular problem are the shorter low ASCII and ISO-8859-1
-- character strings.  We pre-multiply by a magic twiddle factor to
-- obtain a good distribution.  In fact, given the following test:
--
-- > testp :: Int32 -> Int
-- > testp k = (n - ) . length . group . sort . map hs . take n $ ls
-- >   where ls = [] : [c : l | l <- ls, c <- ['\0'..'\xff']]
-- >         hs = foldl' f golden
-- >         f m c = fromIntegral (ord c) * k + hashInt32 m
-- >         n = 100000
--
-- We discover that testp magic = 0.
