-- The class

-- | This class is mainly for syntax re-use, there are many types which are very similar
-- to boolean algebras, but do not have suitable distinguished values to choose for true
-- and false.
--
-- '&&' and '||' should be strict only in their first argument, and return one
-- of their arguments if possible.

    (&&) :: a -> a -> a
    (||) :: a -> a -> a
    --a && b = not (not a || not b)

-- | This is the main class, providing all the operations one would expect on
-- a boolean algebra.

    false :: a
