-- | very safe simplification routine. This will never duplicate terms
-- or change the order terms occur in the formula, so is safe to use even
-- when bottom is present.
--
-- what it does is:
--
-- * removes double negatives
--
-- * evaluates constant terms
--
-- * removes manifest tautologies
--
-- * flattens and of and, or of or
--
-- * flattens single element terms
--
-- if the first argument is true, it also uses de morgan's laws to ensure
-- BoolNot may only occur as the parent of a BoolJust. This may allow
-- additional flattening and simplification, but may increase the number of
-- negations performed and change the ratio between ands and ors done. It does
-- not affect term order either way.
